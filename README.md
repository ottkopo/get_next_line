**get_next_line**

GNL is one of the earlier projects of Hive Helsinki studies. It is a program that just reads one line at a time from any given file descriptor and allocates space for a string for that line. This functionality has been used in multiple later Hive projects, for example Filler (https://github.com/ottkopo/42_filler). It was a fairly simple project that didn't take much time to complete but it's a very useful function!
